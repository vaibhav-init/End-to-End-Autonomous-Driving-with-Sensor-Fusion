### Why Use PCLA?

PCLA (Pretrained CARLA Leaderboard Agents) is a versatile framework designed to decouple the autonomous driving agents (ADAs) from the restrictive CARLA Leaderboard codebase.

* **Decoupled Deployment:** Deploy high-performing ADAs onto a vehicle without relying on the original Leaderboard core codebase.
* **Easy Switching:** Effortlessly switch between **36 different agents** and their **27 additional training seeds** without requiring changes to CARLA versions or programming environments.
* **Version Independent:** Fully compatible with the latest version of CARLA, independent of the Leaderboard’s specific CARLA version.
* **Multi-Agent Support:** Run multiple vehicles with different autonomous agents simultaneously (note: requires high graphical memory).
* **CARLA Action Access:** Retrieve the computed CARLA movement action from the chosen agent for use in any custom application.

The corresponding paper is available at [Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3696630.3728577).

### Compatibility & Video

PCLA was tested on **Linux Ubuntu 22** and **[CARLA 0.9.16](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.16/) (Unreal Engine 4)**.

A video tutorial on how to use PCLA is available below (an updated version is coming soon).

## 1. Setup

### Prerequisites

1.  Download and install the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) from the official website (quick installation or build from source).
2.  Ensure **CUDA** and **PyTorch** are installed on your system.
    * [Tutorial for installing CUDA on Ubuntu](https://www.gpu-mart.com/blog/install-nvidia-cuda-11-on-ubuntu)
    * [Tutorial for PyTorch installation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository and build the Conda environment:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MasoudJTehrani/PCLA
    cd PCLA
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate PCLA
    ```
2.  **Install `torch-scatter` and CUDA Toolkit:**
    > **Note:** Please make sure to install `torch-scatter` and `CUDA Toolkit` according to your specific CUDA version. You can check your CUDA version using the included `python cuda.py` script.

3.  **Additional setup for LMDrive agent:**

    ```bash
    conda activate PCLA
    
    # 1. Vision Encoder
    cd pcla_agents/lmdrive/vision_encoder
    pip uninstall timm
    python setup.py develop
    
    # 2. LAVIS
    cd ../LAVIS
    python setup.py develop
    
    # 3. Fix ftfy dependency
    pip uninstall ftfy -y
    pip install "ftfy==6.1.1"
    cd ../../../
    ```

---

## 2. Pre-Trained Weights

You have two options to download the required pre-trained model weights:

### Option 1: Automatic Download

Run the following script to automatically download and unzip the weights into the correct location:

```bash
python pcla_functions/download_weights.py
```
### Option 2: Manual Download

1.  Manually download the `pretrained.zip` file from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MasoudJTehrani/PCLA/blob/main/pretrained.zip).
    
2.  Extract the contents into the `PCLA/pcla_agents/` directory.
    

### Directory Structure

Ensure that the downloaded pre-trained weight folders are placed directly next to their respective model's folder. The final `pcla_agents` directory should look like this:

```
├── pcla_agents/
│   ├── transfuserv4/
│   ├── transfuserv4_pretrained/
│   ├── interfuser/
│   ├── interfuser_pretrained/
│   ├── ...
```

## 4. How to Use

### Step 1: Run CARLA

Start the CARLA simulator. You **only** need the `-vulkan` flag for LBC, WoR, and LAV agents.

```Bash
./CarlaUE4.sh -vulkan
```

### Step 2: Integrate PCLA in Your Script

Open a new terminal and run your custom Python code. To use PCLA, import the library, define your agent and route, and initialize the `PCLA` class.

**Core Usage Snippet:**

```Python
from PCLA import PCLA

# 1. Define Agent and Route
agent = "tf_tf" # e.g., Transfuser
route = "./sample_route.xml"

# 2. Initialize PCLA (requires a CARLA client and a vehicle object)
pcla = PCLA(agent, vehicle, route, client)

# 3. Get action and apply control (within your simulation loop)
ego_action = pcla.get_action()
vehicle.apply_control(ego_action)

# 4. Cleanup when done
pcla.cleanup()

```

### Explaining the Arguments:

-   **`agent`**: Your chosen autonomous agent string (e.g., `"tf_tf"`). See [Autonomous Agents](#3-autonomous-agents).
    
-   **`route`**: The path to an XML file defining the vehicle's route, formatted according to the Leaderboard waypoints.
    
-   **`client` & `vehicle`**: The standard CARLA client and the ego-vehicle actor you wish to control.
    

----------

## 5. Navigation

PCLA provides utility functions to help you generate waypoints and routes usable by the agents.

### 5.1 Finding Spawn Points

To see all available spawn points and their associated index numbers in your current map:

Shell

```
python pcla_functions/spawn_points.py
```

### 5.2 Generating Waypoints

Use the `location_to_waypoint()` method to generate a sequence of CARLA waypoints between two CARLA locations.

```Python
from PCLA import location_to_waypoint
import carla

world = client.get_world()
vehicle_spawn_points = world.get_map().get_spawn_points() # Get CARLA spawn points
startLoc = vehicle_spawn_points[31].location              # Define Start location
endLoc = vehicle_spawn_points[42].location                # Define End location

# Returns a list of CARLA waypoints between the two locations
waypoints = location_to_waypoint(client, startLoc, endLoc) 

```

### 5.3 Creating the PCLA Route XML

Pass the generated CARLA waypoints to `route_maker()` to format them into a Leaderboard-compliant XML file that PCLA can read.

```Python
from PCLA import route_maker

route_maker(waypoints, "route.xml")
```

### Full Navigation Example

This combined example demonstrates generating an XML route from two [CARLA locations](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlalocation):

```Python
from PCLA import route_maker, location_to_waypoint
import carla

client = carla.Client('localhost', 2000)
world = client.get_world()

vehicle_spawn_points = world.get_map().get_spawn_points()
startLoc = vehicle_spawn_points[31].location
endLoc = vehicle_spawn_points[42].location

# 1. Generate waypoints
waypoints = location_to_waypoint(client, startLoc, endLoc)

# 2. Create the PCLA XML route file
route_maker(waypoints, "route.xml")

```

----------

## 6. Sample Code

A comprehensive sample script is provided to help you test PCLA immediately.

To run the sample (which uses the LAV agent in Town02):

```Bash
python sample.py
```

> **Attention:** You may need to change the vehicle spawn point's index number on **line 45** of `sample.py` based on your specific CARLA version.

## 7. FAQ

Frequently asked questions and possible issues are addressed and solved in [the PCLA issues section](https://github.com/MasoudJTehrani/PCLA/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

If you have a request for a new agent to be integrated into the framework, please feel free to open a new issue and ask!
